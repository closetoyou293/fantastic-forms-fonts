# Fantastic Fonts with Xamarin.Forms
Demo app to go along with the [Fantastic Fonts in Xamarin.Forms blog post](https://codemilltech.com/fantastic-fonts-in-xamarin-forms/).

Everything is ready to run - including the custom font - [Cabin Sketch](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin+Sketch?selection.family=Cabin+Sketch).

Remember on iOS to refer to the font by the __FONT NAME__ and not by the font's file name!!
